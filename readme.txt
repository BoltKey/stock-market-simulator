There are two basic sorts of things you can have - companies and materials.

First, you want to get some Lemonade stalls. They generate lemonade and some money every tick. The price changes all the time, so you want to buy low and sell high to progress.

You can influence the growth rate by clicking the arrows near Growth rate table cell. Growth rate is a magical number, generally the bigger it is, the better the chance of price growth is and vice versa.

You can sell the lemonade (and all the other materials from your inventory). The only way of obtaining materials is from companies. They cannot be bought, and you cannot influence their growth rate (but obviously you still want to sell them as high as possible.
